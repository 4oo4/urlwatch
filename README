        urlwatch - A Simple URL Watcher
       -===============================-


~~ aBOUT ~~

This is a simple URL watcher, designed to send
you diffs of webpages as they change. Ideal for
watching web pages of university courses, so 
you always know when something has changed :)

Q: Where do I configure URLs?
A: Edit the file urls.txt.

Q: A page changes some content on every reload. 
   How do I prevent urlwatch from always 
   displaying these changes?
A: Edit the file hooks.py and add a handler for
   the specific URL and strip the changing
   parts. See hooks.py for more information.

Q: How do I use it as a cron job?
A: Simply add watch.py to your crontab. Make
   sure the stdout of your cronjobs is mailed
   to you, so you get the notifications.
